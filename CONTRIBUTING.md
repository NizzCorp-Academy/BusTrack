- `feature/<name>` â€“ New features (e.g., `feature/login`)  
- `hotfix/<name>` â€“ Emergency fixes (e.g., `hotfix/payment-crash`)  
- `bugfix/<name>` â€“ Bug fixes (e.g., `bugfix/date-format`)

Use this syntax:
<type>(<scope>): <short description>

- `feat`: A new feature  
- `fix`: A bug fix  
- `docs`: Documentation only changes  
- `style`: Code formatting, missing semicolons, etc.  
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature  
- `test`: Adding or correcting tests  
- `chore`: Maintenance (e.g., build process, dependencies)
